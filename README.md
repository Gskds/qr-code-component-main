## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In these project I learn two very important concepts about html and css that is, one how to use semantic html, and placing items at the center through the use of place-item or place-content by assigning it to the value of center.

code snippet

```html
<article>
  ...
</article>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

please give me comment if there is any useless declaration either on html or css. Since I want to write(cod) better html structure and clear and maintainable css
