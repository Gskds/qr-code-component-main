## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In these lesson I learn how to center card by using palce-items or place-content.

Code snippets

```html
<article class="center">
  ...
</article>
```
```css
.center {
  display: grid;
  pace-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

please give me any comment if there is any useless declaration either on html or css since I want to improve on writing better html structure and clear and mentenable css.
